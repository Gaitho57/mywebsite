0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
Understanding Our Project:
The AirBnB clone project involved several steps that ultimately led us to develop a fully functional web application. Our initial focus was on building a command interpreter, which allowed us to interact with and manage AirBnB objects. These objects included User, State, City, Place, and more, each inheriting from a common parent class called BaseModel. The project also involved serialization/deserialization, file storage, and unit testing.

Setting Up Our Project:
To get started, we followed these steps:

    Created the Necessary Files:
        We created Python scripts for each class (User, State, City, Place, etc.) that inherited from BaseModel.
        We implemented the necessary methods for serialization/deserialization within the BaseModel class.
        We wrote a command interpreter script that allowed us to perform operations on these objects.

    Project Structure:
        We organized our project files and folders according to the given requirements.
        We used a folder named "tests" for our unit tests.
        We ensured our project was well-documented using comments, docstrings, and a README.md file.

    Wrote Unit Tests:
        We created unit tests for each class and method we implemented.
        We followed the naming conventions for test files (e.g., tests/test_models/test_base_model.py).
        We utilized the unittest module for writing and executing tests.
        We ran tests using the command: python3 -m unittest discover tests or tested individual files: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py.

    Ensured Code Quality:
        We followed PEP 8 style guidelines for our code.
        We used the pycodestyle tool to check for code style compliance.
        We ensured our code files ended with a new line and had the correct shebang line (#!/usr/bin/python3).

    Documentation:
        We wrote comprehensive docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.
        We described the purpose and usage of each module, class, and function.
        We made sure our README.md file provided clear instructions on how to use and set up our project.

    Version Control:
        We initialized a Git repository for our project.
        We regularly committed our changes and pushed them to a remote repository on GitHub.

This project was an excellent opportunity for us to apply our software engineering skills, and we were excited to take on the challenge. By following these steps, we were well on our way to creating a functional AirBnB clone and gaining valuable experience in software development.
